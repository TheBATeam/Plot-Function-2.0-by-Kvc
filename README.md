# Plot-Function-2.0-by-Kvc
The Plot Function 2.0 is an amazing function, it is based on the pure use of mathematics. Graphs help us in many ways, they provide a simple and easy view of complex equations or problems. You can analyze any system using the graphs or plots easily.

# ADVANCED MATHEMATICAL PLOTTING IN CMD
Here, we’re trying to understand “how do the advanced programming languages become so advanced?” using our **batch programming** skills. Playing with **mathematics** is so much fun when you try to calculate and achieve something, and only one mathematics technique can provide you with everything.

# WHAT’S NEW IN PLOT FUNCTION 2.0?
The function should be intelligent enough to understand the points and adjust itself according to that.

So, we analyzed the function more and tried to make some more calculations to adjust the output according to the input given by the user. After spending some hours with a pen and copy, we finally made a mathematical model of the requirement we want in the function. Now, the function started working more intelligently than the previous version.

The layout or format of the plot file is the same as of 1.0. All lines starting with ‘#’ are comments and rest you can see in the image.

You can even find the intersection of two equations graphically via using this plot function. For example, to find the intersection of Lines in the format:
```Y=5x+5```
and
```Y=-5x+5```
Just calculate the corresponding values of ‘Y’, with respect to ‘X’ using a for loop, for both the equations and plot the co-ordinates using this plot function. You can see a result below.
